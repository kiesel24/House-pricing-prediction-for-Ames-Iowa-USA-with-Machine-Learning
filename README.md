# House-pricing-prediction-for-Ames-Iowa-USA-with-Machine-Learning

25.11.2022: This project is on going and not finished. Right now the project is in feature engineering state.

This project has the goal to predict the house pricing of Ames, a big city in Iowa, USA. 

The dataset has 1460 rows and 80 different features. The challenge of this project is going to be to clean data (diffecult, because the big amount), find the right features, detect outlier (tune the detecting to prefent underfitting), feature engineering, find the right ML Model and to tune the hyperparameters.

At the end this project will be deployed on a website and be accessible to predict their house pices in Ames.
